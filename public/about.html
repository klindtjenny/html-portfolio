<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jenny Klindt and I'm from Norrköping, Sweden. I have a Bachelor's degree in behavioral science, specifically psychology. </p>

<p>I have a lot of creative interests such as: art/drawing, polymer clay, singing, dancing, playing instruments and makramé. 
The last couple of years I have also developed an interest in coding and tech.</p>

<p>This webpage aim to show what I have learned during my udemy classes and create a portfolio. It will be updated every time I create a new project. I hope you like what you see so far!
  Have a great one!
