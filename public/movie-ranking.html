<h3>Lion King (1994)</h3>
<p>
The most beautiful disney-movie. I cry my eyes out everytime. 
</p>
<h3>Inside Out (2015)</h3>
<p>
A genius and funny movie about feelings and psychology, explained in a educational way. Love the message and the way it was written. 
</p>
<h3>Spider man (2002-)</h3>
<p>
Yes, this is sort of a movie series, but I love it. I like this type of hero that is not as "macho" in a sence. I like the ones with Tom Holland the best, then Tobey Maguire and lastly Andrew Garfield.
